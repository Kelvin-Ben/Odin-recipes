# Odin-recipes 
I am working on Creating a recipe through html and at the end i will have learnt how to add repos to GitHub.
# I have completed the assignment:
    1. I created the main page i.e index.html
    2. I created other three pages and linked them with main page
    3. I used "git pull" and "git push" to update my repositories
